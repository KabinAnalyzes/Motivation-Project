# Motivational Web App

## Overview

Welcome to the Motivation Tracker web application! This application utilizes Python Flask for the backend and HTML and CSS for the frontend. Its main purpose is to provide users with daily motivational quotes, allow them to add tasks they need to complete, and track their progress throughout the month. Additionally, as a source of motivation, the application displays a growing plant when users complete all their tasks for the day.

## Features

### Daily Motivational Quotes
The application uses an external [motivational quote API](docs.zenquotes.io) to provide users with a fresh quote every day. This feature helps users stay motivated and inspired throughout their day.

### Task Tracking
Users can add tasks they need to complete and mark them as complete when finished. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks, ensuring users can stay organized and focused.

### Plant Growth
As a form of motivation, the application rewards users with a growing plant when they complete all their tasks for the day. The more tasks completed, the healthier the plant grows, providing a visual representation of the user's progress.

### Monthly Progress Tracking
The application keeps track of all completed days throughout the month. At the end of each month, users receive a rating based on their overall performance. This rating reflects their consistency and helps them analyze their progress over time
